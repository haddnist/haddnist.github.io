Hey there, welcome to my personal website! I'm a first-year undergrad at BITS Pilani, Pilani campus. Right now, I'm super interested in exploring the world of machine learning and all the amazing things you can do with it.

On this website, you'll find updates on my latest projects, tutorials, and blog posts as I navigate my way through this exciting field. I'm all about sharing what I learn and helping others along the way, so join me on my journey as we discover the endless possibilities of technology together.

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find my website informative, entertaining, and just a little bit quirky!
